      DataMed systems are designed to store data accurately and to capture the state of a patient
      across time. Our systems eliminate the need to track down a patient's previous paper medical
      records and assists in ensuring data is accurate and legible. DataMed systems can reduce risk
      of data replication as there is only one modifiable file, which means the file is more likely
      up to date, and decreases risk of lost paperwork. Due to the digital information being
      searchable and in a single file, EMRs are more effective when extracting medical data for the
      examination of possible trends and long term changes in a patient. Population-based studies of
      medical records may also be facilitated by the widespread adoption of EHRs and EMRs.
